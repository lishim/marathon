# Metrics

Marathon uses [Dropwizard Metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)
for its metrics. You can query the current metric values via the
`/metrics` HTTP endpoint.

For the specific syntax see the
[metrics command-line flags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/command-line-flags.html#metrics-flags)
section.

## Stability of metric names

Although we try to prevent unnecessary disruptions, we do not provide
stability guarantees for metric names between major and minor releases.

## Metric types

Marathon has the following metric types:

* a `counter` is a monotonically increasing integer, for instance, the
  number of Mesos `revive` calls performed since Marathon became
  a leader.
* a `gauge` is a current measurement, for instance, the number of apps
  currently known to Marathon.
* a `histogram` is a distribution of values in a stream of measurements,
  for instance, the number of apps in group deployments.
* a `meter` measures the rate at which a set of events occur.
* a `timer` is a combination of a meter and a histogram, which measure
  the duration of events and the rate of their occurrence.

Histograms and timers are backed with reservoirs leveraging
[HdrHistogram](http://hdrhistogram.org/).

## Units of measurement

Metrics can be measured in the following units:

* none
* `bytes`
* `seconds`

## Metric names

All metric names are prefixed with `marathon` by default. The prefix can
be changed using `--metrics_prefix` command-line flag.

Metric name components are joined with dots. Components may have dashes
in them.

A metric type and a unit of measurement (if any) are appended to
a metric name. A couple of examples:

* `marathon.apps.active.gauge`
* `marathon.http.event-streams.responses.size.counter.bytes`

## Prometheus reporter

The Prometheus reporter can be enabled with `--metrics_prometheus`
command-line flag. When enabled, metrics in the Prometheus format are
available at `/metrics/prometheus`.

Dots and dashes in metric names are replaced with underscores.

## StatsD reporter

The StatsD reporter can be enabled with `--metrics_statsd` command-line
flag. It sends metrics over UDP to the host and port specified with
`--metrics_statsd_host` and `--metrics_statsd_port` respectively.

## DataDog reporter

The DataDog reporter can be enabled with `--metrics_datadog`
command-line flag. It sends metrics over UDP to the host and port
specified with `--metrics_datadog_host` and `--metrics_datadog_port`
respectively.
